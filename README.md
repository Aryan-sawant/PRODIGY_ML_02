# Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of K-means clustering to group retail store customers based on their purchase history. Explore customer segmentation and learn how to visualize cluster centroids using Matplotlib scatter plots.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need to install the required dependencies. Use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Load your customer data into the project.
2. Run the K-means clustering algorithm.
3. Visualize cluster centroids using Matplotlib scatter plots.
4. Analyze the resulting clusters to gain insights into customer behavior.

## Data
You can obtain the customer data used in this project from [link to data source].

## Algorithm Details
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points into clusters. Dive into the algorithm's inner workings and see how it's applied to customer segmentation.

## Results
The project's results are available in the [results folder](/results). Check out the [analysis notebook](/notebooks/analysis.ipynb) for detailed insights.
